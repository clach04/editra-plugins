From 

sample setup:

    editra -c /some/path # then quit, this creates undef conf directory
    cp egg /some/path/plugins
    editra -c /some/path # can now load/save files ending in gz

## TODO

  * implement `FIXME call super instead`, rather than raw file io, so as to allow plugin chaining.
  * address all FIXME and TODO items
